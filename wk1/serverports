Question 1:
A port is identified for each transport protocol and address combination by a 16-bit unsigned number, known as the port number.

Question 2:
A port number is a 16-bit unsigned integer, thus ranging from 0 to 65535. 
For TCP, port number 0 is reserved and cannot be used, while for UDP, the source port is optional and a value of zero means no port.
